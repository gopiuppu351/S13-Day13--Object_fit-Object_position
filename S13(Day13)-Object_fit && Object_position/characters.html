      In the movie "Raayan", Dhanush plays the titular character,
      Kaartavaraayan, also known as Raayan. His character is a complex blend of
      a peace-loving protector and a fierce warrior when provoked. Living a
      quiet life with his siblings in the village of Anjanaouram, Raayan takes

      mysterious circumstances. His peaceful existence is disrupted when a
      conflict with a local gangster, Dorai, escalates into a full-blown feud,
